## Existing repository references

The prior repository configuration listed seven optional collections: hanlulong/econ-writing-skill, claesbackman/AI-research-feedback, matteocourthoud/awesome-causal-inference, meleantonio/awesome-econ-ai-stuff, hanlulong/awesome-ai-for-economists, Imbad0202/academic-research-skills and affaan-m/ECC. Their installed local pointer skills were inspected during this request. The final configuration uses self-contained task methods and retrieves external references for a specific dependency.

The review also read workflow overviews from pedrohcgs/claude-code-my-workflow, tsdfs930514/econ-research-workflow and economics paper-review/slide collections.

## Supplied research standards

The supplied R00-R08 modules contribute the five-section paper explanation, actual-assignment identification checks, measurement and reproduction standards, source routing, plain LaTeX/Beamer artifacts and evidence-linked review. The local configuration separates these substantive responsibilities from the prose method and keeps study-specific choices in task inputs.

Mahoney (2022), DOI 10.1257/jep.36.3.211, supplies the five principles linking descriptive and model-based research (pp. 215-218), alternatives for research ordering (pp. 219-220) and the assumptions-to-results framework (Figure 1, p. 220). The supplied 12-page paper is the source. The dedicated reference labels this configuration's operational translation separately.

## Second review: reproducible project settings

Rechecked 2026-09-27. Each source below was read at its README or official-documentation level. These sources supply workflow choices for the actual research task.

| Primary source | Observed design | Local decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/econ-project-templates | Pixi and a dependency-driven data-to-paper pipeline | Preserve the runner and rerun affected outputs; reproduce fully when requested. |
| https://github.com/rhstanton/project_template | Traceable data, code and publication exhibits; selectable languages | Preserve existing links between claims, code and outputs, and the repository's chosen languages. |
| https://github.com/maxwell2732/codex-stata-for-economists/blob/main/README.en.md | Numerical claims tied to logs and output tables | Carry run evidence with each reportable result. |
| https://github.com/pedrohcgs/claude-code-my-workflow | Replication checks, claim provenance and handoffs | Use result-relevant checks and existing task records for requested transfers. |
| https://github.com/tsdfs930514/econ-research-workflow | Lifecycle skills and cross-validation | Keep task routing; additional execution follows a concrete research need. |
| https://developers.openai.com/blog/skills-agents-sdk | Short repository policy, task metadata, selected bodies and deterministic scripts | Keep one policy, bounded discovery and no default external-repository loading. |
| https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/agents-md | Repository-level instruction discovery | Retain compact host pointers to the existing policy owner. |


## Semantic writing adaptations (2026-10-06)

The review read the sources and sections below. Local adaptations retain requested facts, quantities, attribution and causal relations while removing defensive propositions and stock framing. The policy and selected skill contain the current operating rules.

| Current source and inspected revision | Read material | Local operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Kiterlin/anti-defensive-writing](https://github.com/Kiterlin/anti-defensive-writing/blob/c7edf8fc91ae9c4f7e58345bd12934bb4cf41c46/skill/anti-defensive-writing/SKILL.md), c7edf8fc91ae9c4f7e58345bd12934bb4cf41c46 | Core and additional rules, Preserve Necessary Precision, rewrite procedure, final pass, patterns, examples and English/Chinese sections | Organize around the claim and rebuild paragraphs. Apply semantic admission to positive scope conversions, limitation allowances, hedges and reviewer framing. |
| [nanaism/yomiyasu](https://github.com/nanaism/yomiyasu/blob/986da6ffc89316a90e509d007c1efe1fc59057e6/SKILL.md), 986da6ffc89316a90e509d007c1efe1fc59057e6 | §1 meaning, register, paragraph relations, subject/object alignment, literal verbs and information; §2 procedure; §3 output | Preserve admitted factual relations and align actor, object and predicate. Apply deletion to evaluations, metaphorical implications and corrective contrasts. |
| [makotofalcon/humanizer-ja](https://github.com/makotofalcon/humanizer-ja/blob/4cc01cdd5aff4102888e9396c3ba16da99828f78/SKILL.md), 4cc01cdd5aff4102888e9396c3ba16da99828f78 | Principles, human voice, patterns 1–25 and 11b, process and output | Delete appended significance, vague authority, promotion and stock conclusions. Use the admission rule for residual hedges, personal voice and digressions. |
| [Silas1929/econ-writing](https://github.com/Silas1929/econ-writing/blob/ba636f282fc80b12dbed623752b76c1513cd73ea/SKILL.md), ba636f282fc80b12dbed623752b76c1513cd73ea | Complete SKILL: core principles, quick reference, four modes and general guidelines | State results first with plain verbs. Apply categorical deletion to hedge allowances, one-off usage, alternate contrast forms and routine conclusion caveats. |

These are original local rules and examples adapted from the identified operations. The inspected repositories license their files under MIT: [Kiterlin, copyright 2026](https://github.com/Kiterlin/anti-defensive-writing/blob/c7edf8fc91ae9c4f7e58345bd12934bb4cf41c46/LICENSE), [nanaism, copyright 2026](https://github.com/nanaism/yomiyasu/blob/986da6ffc89316a90e509d007c1efe1fc59057e6/LICENSE), and [humanizer-ja, copyright 2025](https://github.com/makotofalcon/humanizer-ja/blob/4cc01cdd5aff4102888e9396c3ba16da99828f78/LICENSE).

Earlier wording references recorded in patterns.md on 2026-10-01 remain attributable to [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer/blob/main/SKILL.md), [softaworks/writing-clearly-and-concisely](https://github.com/softaworks/agent-toolkit/blob/main/skills/writing-clearly-and-concisely/SKILL.md), [Keizai Seminar's introduction article](https://note.com/keisemi/n/n6442eac8af25), and [Cochrane's Writing Tips](https://www.fma.org/assets/docs/membercontent/writing_cochrane.pdf). Their recorded operations concern paragraph development, literal subjects and direct contributions. The default-micro corpus, its inspected-version records and its source locators remain in their existing reference.

## Proposition-first reconstruction (2026-10-06)

The review read [root SKILL.md](https://github.com/Kiterlin/anti-defensive-writing/blob/c7edf8fc91ae9c4f7e58345bd12934bb4cf41c46/SKILL.md), commit `c7edf8fc91ae9c4f7e58345bd12934bb4cf41c46`: core and additional rules, functional diagnosis, rewrite procedure, paragraph construction and examples. Its claim-forward procedure reconstructs paragraphs around substantive claims and removes defensive propositions, preemptive rebuttals and apology-like framing. The previously recorded yomiyasu and humanizer-ja operations supply concrete subjects, aligned predicates, literal verbs, stable terminology and deletion of appended evaluation and stock phrasing.

## Instruction ownership and task exports (2026-10-08)

This refactor uses the supplied Evidence Pack and Source Locators at their recorded repository baselines. econ-project-mini is the editing source for the explicit common-core paths. Project choices remain in [repo_context.md](repo_context.md), synchronization and export commands in [integration.md](integration.md), and source histories in this file. The supplied replacement content-admission and expression rules are maintained by [econ-assertive](../../.agents/skills/econ-assertive/SKILL.md).

Existing R00-R08 bridge attachments retain their original substantive methods; supplied R00_ROUTER.md owns their provider map. Earlier source, adaptation and license records above remain historical attribution.

## Information design and writing quality (2026-10-08)

The source passages below informed the existing skills and profiles. Shared information selection, clarity and continuity belong to econ-assertive; composition to econ-writing; meaning-preserving revision to econ-edit; source-based profile learning to econ-style. The adaptations use original wording and preserve scientific definitions, comparisons, quantities and conditions.

Hedge allowances, concessions, cautious alternatives, generic limitations and defensive disclaimers are excluded. Fixed word counts, sentence counts, contribution counts, forced paragraph sequences and deliberate roughness are also excluded. Profiles transfer argument and information placement to target evidence.

Validation used the existing skill-creator frontmatter check for four revised skills and independent edits of Ruan introduction, institutions and design passages. Citation commands, the specification equation, quantities and scientific conditions were retained. The observed institutional paragraph mixing led to revised population/identifier and supply-stage transfer directions in the Ruan profile. Verification rewrites remain outside the research originals.

The existing default-micro corpus was retained. Re-read the published [Egger et al. PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13KC9FwbvqbouTDmEykLmLlEWgOe6hP9f/view), pp.2604–2606, for the question-to-variation-to-observation chain and the expenditure-based multiplier; and [Gershenson et al. PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17GNBlDGzF9WKB0fFvN7kpXTDI6ZOrZUH/view), pp.315–316 and Table 2, for estimate, uncertainty and baseline relations. The existing source versions and reading map remain in default-micro.

## Generative writing refinement (2026-10-09)

Ordinary native econ-writing requests generated a Japanese Ruan mechanism explanation, a Japanese Introduction and an English Identification section from the canonical research records. Each run recorded the actual method, profile, read sections and content hashes. Independent review separated sentence/paragraph compliance, readability, source fidelity and conditional reasoning. Generated drafts remained outside the research originals.

The failures led to revisions at their existing owners: econ-assertive reconstructs the completed draft, separates independent definitions and operations, and retains the same scientific conditions in summaries; econ-writing selects the requested argument and carries a decision condition from incentives to actions and group quantities; econ-style makes profile examples enact their transfer directions. Default-micro explains the relation from a descriptive pattern to a research judgment and groups outcome estimates by an explicit economic relation. Result transfer preserves the distinct study, baseline, treatment and outcome windows, and separates non-detection, approximate equality and exact zero. Ruan's profile defines legal terms at first use, preserves identifier units and publication coverage, and separates quantity construction from attribute linkage.

Re-read [Silas paragraph and sentence references](https://github.com/Silas1929/econ-writing/tree/ba636f282fc80b12dbed623752b76c1513cd73ea), paragraph §§1–2, 4, 6, 8 and sentence §§2, 6–9, 11–14; [lishn6 paper-style-learner](https://github.com/lishn6/awesome-ai-econ-research-writing/blob/639285453d451d765da66cfae559bc3e5e24d137/skills/paper-style-learner/SKILL.md), extraction priorities and evidence discipline; [Cochrane](https://www.johnhcochrane.com/s/phd_paper_writing.pdf), pp.3, 5–10; and [Kiterlin's existing adaptation source](https://github.com/Kiterlin/anti-defensive-writing/blob/c7edf8fc91ae9c4f7e58345bd12934bb4cf41c46/skill/anti-defensive-writing/SKILL.md), Rewrite Procedure and Final Pass. Retain reconstruction, explicit relations and evidence-matched claim strength. Exclude hedge allowances, defensive reformulations, stock caveats and fixed length/structure quotas.

The supplied Galasso and Luo (2026) theory section, pp.485–486, supplies the payoff-to-choice relation. Alpert et al. (2022), pp.1154–1155, separates its principal comparison, alternative comparison and inference. Gruber et al. (2025), p.270, links each population/source construction to its economic role. Their existing profile source records retain the inspected PDF versions.

The final three Ruan tasks passed every required prose and scientific-meaning criterion. Results generation from [Bessone et al. (2021)](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2022-09/economic-sleep-qje.pdf), Table IV and pp.1926, 1929–1930, exposed source-transfer errors in non-detection, approximate equality, treatment duration and outcome grouping; fresh generation after the Results refinement passed. An independent task from [Kline, Rose and Walters (2022)](https://ekrose.github.io/files/randres.pdf), Tables II and IV, also passed, including average effects, between-firm dispersion, units, denominators and uncertainty. No generated verification draft was hand-edited. The Results-only refinement was outside the three Ruan tasks' recorded reading/selection, whose unchanged instruction coverage retained its passing evidence.

The existing frontmatter validator passed for econ-assertive, econ-writing and econ-style. Shared bytes matched the 34-path contract; scientific records, paper/code/data and persistent profile selections stayed in their owners. Committed source identity belongs to the existing integration receipts and exported SOURCE.md records.


## Coordinated research and verified execution (read 2026-10-09)

The team extension addresses missing execution state, completion evidence, independent oversight and resumption. It preserves the eleven specialist methods and their existing writing corpus. All new instructions and the stdlib helper are original local implementation; no external runtime or source code is vendored.

### Free-tool selection

| Candidate and inspected version | Function and current change record | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Cezar](https://github.com/open-mercato/cezar/tree/1a34fe0fc262c1ea7d3a22f953bb19ac82c3acbf), package 0.14.0, [MIT](https://github.com/open-mercato/cezar/blob/1a34fe0fc262c1ea7d3a22f953bb19ac82c3acbf/LICENSE) | README: file-based state and Codex login. [Codex runner](https://github.com/open-mercato/cezar/blob/1a34fe0fc262c1ea7d3a22f953bb19ac82c3acbf/packages/cezar/src/core/codex-app-server-runner.ts) lines 47–59, 415–420 and usage event handling: account auth or API auth, autonomous default permissions, ignored allowedTools. October 8 commits add graph execution (9230faac), branding (3b0d2d1f) and repair assertions (1a34fe0f). GitHub commits API queried with since=2026-09-09. | Not installed. Native delegation/resume plus the existing task record and local helper satisfy this assignment. A second runtime would duplicate state and require reconciling its default approval/sandbox behavior. Package licensing does not establish free model inference. |
| [ccusage](https://github.com/ccusage/ccusage/tree/ee04dbf1ae9ad2b447dc94473d2e6bda47613171), [MIT](https://github.com/ccusage/ccusage/blob/ee04dbf1ae9ad2b447dc94473d2e6bda47613171/apps/ccusage/LICENSE) | README Supported Sources, JSON/offline/no-cost reporting. The root LICENSE points to apps/ccusage/LICENSE; that actual file was read. October 9 updates models.dev (ee04dbf1, 2dca8650) and LiteLLM (43f5d48e) pricing snapshots; commits API queried with since=2026-09-09. | Not installed. This run receives direct Codex JSONL usage, so a separate report parser adds no missing function. API-equivalent price estimates are not invoices. Consider later for a local cross-session view. |
| [SQLite/FTS5](https://sqlite.org/fts5.html), container SQLite 3.37.2; [public domain](https://sqlite.org/copyright.html) | Read FTS5 overview, table creation and external-content synchronization; [release history](https://sqlite.org/changes.html) checked for 2026-09-09–2026-10-09 and lists no release in that interval. An in-memory FTS5 table was created successfully in the existing Python runtime. | No second DB or index is created. Exact IDs and text search cover the present task store and source collection. Retain the existing runtime; adopt indexing only after measured search/state scale requires it. |

LangGraph, Pydantic AI, Promptfoo, Langfuse, Phoenix and OPA remain uninstalled candidates. No demonstrated missing execution function requires them. Their installation cost alone would not verify a free inference path.


### Common synchronization and environment sources (common-core reader, 2026-10-09)

| Primary source and edition | Inspected passage | Adoption and confirmation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Git configuration](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config), documentation 2.56.0 updated 2026-09-28; container Git 2.34.1 | core.fileMode, displayed lines 1748–1755 | Preserve executable-mode ownership and refuse incompatible target filesystems. Do not change a user's core.fileMode setting to bypass a synchronization refusal. New Python-invoked helper files use mode 644. |
| [Docker build context](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/context/), fetched 2026-10-09; page publication/update date not displayed | .dockerignore, displayed lines 341–413 | Exclude local operational state, auth caches, secrets and environment files from the build context. Existing mounted data and cache structures remain intact. |
| [Docker build secrets](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/secrets/), fetched 2026-10-09; page publication/update date not displayed | Displayed lines 30–33 | Keep build secrets out of Docker ARG and ENV. No secret mechanism is changed or credential extracted. |
| [VS Code sharing Git credentials](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/sharing-git-credentials), fetched 2026-10-09 | Host .gitconfig and credential-helper behavior, displayed lines 23–32 | Remove personal Git-author Docker defaults and use the user's existing Git settings and official credential-helper path. Container username remains separate from commit-author identity. |

The common-core worker inspected these primary passages and implemented the corresponding sync/Docker changes. These are original repository explanations; no documentation paragraphs or source code are copied, and no repository license is newly selected.


### Native CLI cumulative usage semantics (2026-10-09)

Read OpenAI Codex [JSONL event processor](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/rust-v0.160.1/codex-rs/exec/src/event_processor_with_jsonl_output.rs) at the installed `rust-v0.160.1` tag: `usage_from_last_total`, lines 118–128, and `ThreadTokenUsageUpdated`/`TurnCompleted`, lines 509–534. Completed-turn output copies the thread's cumulative total, including cached-input and reasoning-output counters. Read [token-usage replay](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/rust-v0.160.1/codex-rs/app-server/src/request_processors/token_usage_replay.rs) for resumed-history reconstruction. Lines 119-121 also default to all zero when usage information is absent, so an unverified all-zero observation is retained raw and normalized as unknown. The same-ID native resume increased the original counters and confirmed this behavior. The original run and correction raw records are retained; increments are differences within the verified epoch.

Adoption: the local helper binds raw counter observations to session, explicit epoch, chronological sequence and hash. It computes additive totals across distinct sessions/epochs and cumulative deltas within one epoch, regardless of import order. Unknown/reset semantics remain null. The original implementation is referenced under its [Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/rust-v0.160.1/LICENSE); no source code is copied and this repository's license remains unchanged.

### Setup failure and Git trust preservation (2026-10-09)

Read [Git configuration](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config), documentation 2.56.0 updated 2026-09-28, `safe.directory` and `--add` (displayed lines 4572–4578). Container Git 2.34.1 supports the inspected commands. The workspace trust entry is added only when absent; existing entries and commit-author settings remain intact. Isolated-home fixtures execute setup twice and check byte-identical second-run configuration. Dependency-installation and required-kernel failures stop setup. Kernel registration follows the requested R dependency transaction. These local explanations and implementations do not copy documentation or change licensing.

## Natural economics writing revision — sources read 2026-10-09

The current revision keeps concise task boundaries and source-based examples, with representative generated artifacts used to judge the prose. It does not add fixed rhetorical moves, sentence quotas, lexical bans or a machine quality score.

| Primary source and verified edition | Passage actually read | Use in this revision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Eric Provencher, [Rethinking skills and prompts for GPT-6 Astra](https://developers.openai.com/blog/rethinking-skills-and-prompts-for-gpt-6-astra), 2026-09-11 | Better skills; Up-to-date AGENTS.md; Decision boundaries; Persistence | Keep descriptions selective and short, disclose references by task, and replace universal recipes with appropriate boundaries. This is official guidance, not evidence that the present writing candidate performs better. |
| OpenAI, [A model guide for the GPT-6 family](https://openai.com/index/practical-guide-building-gpt-6/), 2026-10-02 | Prepare your workflow for production: representative tasks; Adjust your prompts and skills: assignment and output | Define the reader, deliverable and completion evidence, and inspect representative outputs. The URL's practical-guide shorthand is not the article title. No model, effort, paid API or runtime setting is changed. |
| Abdelrahman Sadallah, Narjes Sheikh Asadi and Lonneke van der Plas, [Does AI-Generated Scientific Text Follow Human Argumentation Patterns? A CARS-Based Comparison of Research Article Introductions](https://arxiv.org/html/2610.01353v1), arXiv:2610.01353v1, 2026-10-01, CC BY 4.0 | Abstract; §4.1 ending and §4.2; §6 Conclusion; Appendix K prompt descriptions | In its linguistics-introduction comparison, source authors select and reorder rhetorical moves more flexibly than the generated sets; supplying CARS definitions further narrows model structures. Learn from concrete passages without imposing that move scheme. Its annotator/detection results are not transferred to this model or task. |
| Thomas Kosch, Robin Welsch, Michael Hedderich and Christopher Katins, [How Did Writing Change At CHI? Analyzing 44 Years of CHI Writing Before and After the Introduction of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2609.23090v1), arXiv:2609.23090v1, 2026-09-19, CC BY 4.0 | Abstract; §3 Corpus; selected passages in §§5.2, 5.5–5.8; §6.1 | The reported 14,262-contribution CHI corpus shows denser prose, wider vocabulary and nonuniform sentence rhythm, with several trends preceding public LLM use. Marker words vary over time and venue. Use reader comprehension, not word-list absence, as the present quality judgment; the observational study does not identify this workflow's causal performance. |

All four dated sources fall within 2026-09-09–2026-10-09. The OpenAI pages are referenced and paraphrased without claiming a reuse license or copying text/code. The two arXiv v1 licenses were checked on their HTML headers. Their ideas are attributed in original wording; no paper text, code or annotation scheme is vendored, and repository licensing is unchanged. Source performance percentages are not adopted as local results.

The default profile's original ten source records remain intact. Its new short adaptations use the actual Egger, Bessone and Kline passages, and Japanese syntax was informed by the three IER original articles recorded once in [default-micro](../../.agents/skills/econ-assertive/references/default-micro.md). The evidence for the new candidate remains the next fresh generation and independent reading.
